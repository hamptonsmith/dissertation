1) Introduces a new type, E, that represents the even numbers.
2) Introduces two named even numbers: 0 and 2.
3) Introduces a definition, Next_Even, that takes an even number and returns another (this is a precis, so no need to provide a body.)
4) Asserts for the type system that any even number is also an integer.
5) Asserts for the type system that the product of two even numbers is also even.
6) Asserts that for any two even numbers, e1 and e2, Next_Even(e1 * e2) = ((e1 + 1) * e2).
7) Introduces a new type, T, that represents multiples of ten.
8) Asserts for the type system that any multiple of ten is also an integer.
9) Introduces a definition, Without_Last_Zero, that takes a T and returns a Z.
10) Asserts that Without_Last_Zero(10) = 1.  This may require an extra step to establish proper symbols.
11) Asserts that for any multiple of ten, t, Next_Even(t) mod 10 = 2.  This may require some additional steps to establish proper symbols and relationships.
12) Asserts that for all multiples of ten, t, and integers, i, Without_Last_Zero(t * i) = i.  This may require some additional steps.
